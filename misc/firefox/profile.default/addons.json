It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license

is a universal night mode for the entire Internet. It uses a special algorithm to automatically change the colors of the websites you visit into dark mode so that you can browse without straining your eyes, especially at night.","fullDescription":"Dark Night Mode is a Free Open Source Software which makes all the websites you browse into dark/night mode so that you can browse the internet without straining your eyes. It is an extremely useful FireFox extension for those who use internet especially at night. It is also available for Google Chrome.\n\nWe use a unique algorithm to apply dark mode to all the websites in real-time as you browse. It basically detects the color of each element of a website and intelligently converts it to a darker shade. Bright colors are darkened at more intensity than dark colors so that most of the colors are preserved. Unlike other similar extensions, we do NOT invert the colors, so black websites will not change its color into white. An added benefit is that the images will also not be distorted!\n\nWe have also put immense effort in eliminating the flashes of bright white screen while loading different websites. We were able to eliminate this problem with 99.9% success rate.\n\nUsing the brightness slider, you can adjust the brightness of your browser beyond what your computer's brightness adjuster allows. This is useful in dimming the brightness to your likening. For example, by default the images are shown with normal color, but you can darken it by sliding down the brightness slider.\n\nThere is also an Auto mode which will automatically turn on the Dark Mode at night 8:00PM and will turn off at morning 6:00AM. It was complicated to develop an option to customize this timing, but we are working on it and may add this option in the future versions.\n\nThere is also Whitelist feature which can be helpful if you do not want the dark mode to work on certain websites.\n\nSince this extension will darken all the websites you visit at night, you will initially not enjoy it due to the huge change in your routine. However, our internal studies have shown that people start getting used to it after about three weeks of use. Some people have claimed that this extension helps them sleep better while some others have said that it helped them reduce the burning sensation in their eyes caused by extensive browsing of the internet in the dark.\n\nThis plugin is NOT 100% perfect. It never will be perfect because many websites are developed in a non-standard fashion and there is no easy way to detect a site and perfectly change its colors in real time withing milli-seconds so that the user do not see the bright colors. It is a double edged sword - If we add more conditions to make the algorithm smarter, then it will affect the processing speed and the user will see flashes of white light, so we had to make some choices to get an optimal balance.\n\nIt took us - two developers two whole months of full time developmental efforts to conceptualize, design, code, test, calibrate and deploy this extension. We had initially started it as a side project aiming to make it in couple of days, but it ended up taking significantly more time than expected! We hope you enjoy it.","weeklyDownloads":3295,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Dark Night Mode","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13974359/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/201/201458.png?modified=1543521242","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/201/201458.png?modified=1543521242","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/201/201457.png?modified=1543521248","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/201/201457.png?modified=1543521248","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/201/201459.png?modified=1543521255","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/201/201459.png?modified=1543521255","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4384,"reviewCount":86,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-night-mode/reviews/","updateDate":1524409807000}],"compatOverrides":[]}
